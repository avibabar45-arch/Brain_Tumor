# Brain_Tumor 
## Description

Analyzing a brain tumor dataset from Kaggle. It imports the dataset using kagglehub, performs data preprocessing (handling categorical values with Label Encoding, mapping tumor type into binary labels for Malignant and Benign, checking duplicates, missing values, and dataset shape), and then applies exploratory data analysis using correlations and visualizations with Seaborn/Matplotlib. After cleaning and encoding, it implements different machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest Classifier, and Linear Regression (likely for comparison, though not ideal for classification). The models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, MSE, and R² score. Overall, the notebook aims to build and compare predictive models that can classify brain tumors as malignant or benign based on clinical and diagnostic features.


## Project Overview 
This project focuses on the analysis and prediction of brain tumor types using machine learning techniques. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains demographic, clinical, and diagnostic details of patients, including age, gender, tumor location, histology, symptoms, treatments, MRI results, and follow-up requirements. The primary goal is to classify tumors as Benign or Malignant, which is critical for early diagnosis and treatment planning.
